                <p><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong></p>
<p><strong>NORWICH, ENGLAND:</strong> LiveG Technologies today announces the first Alpha pre-release of its in-development operating system, LiveG OS, for PinePhone and Raspberry Pi devices.</p>
<p>This new release — version 0.2.0 Alpha — makes LiveG OS one of only a few existing operating systems that can run on both desktop and mobile devices, providing a consistent user interface across multiple device form factors.</p>
<p>Founder and lead developer of LiveG, James Livesey, said: "this new release marks a significant milestone in the development of our operating system, and we're looking forward to seeing users try out LiveG OS for themselves on their own devices.</p>
<p>"It's been over a year and a half since we started development on LiveG OS, back when we built the first prototype of our open-source smartphone, the LiveG Prism. We're proud of the progress that we have already made — day by day, LiveG OS is getting closer to what we envision as a powerful, modern operating system.</p>
<p>"Our mission at LiveG is to create technology for everyone. That means building software that's freely available, open-source, intuitive to users of all abilities, available in many languages, and fully accessible to users with additional needs and preferences. As an important product in our emerging ecosystem, LiveG OS is already helping us to reach this mission."</p>
<p>An important aspect of LiveG OS is its new ability to install progressive web apps (PWAs). PWAs behave just like typical apps installed from app stores on other operating systems, but with the advantage that they run on multiple existing operating systems as well as on LiveG OS. This opens up LiveG OS to thousands of existing web apps, allowing LiveG OS to compete with today's established operating systems in ways that would not be possible without PWA support. </p>
<p>LiveG OS also comes with a number of new features that bring the system closer to competing operating systems, including search options in the app menu; a tab-based interface in the integrated Sphere web browser; a new, gesture-based app switching system on mobile devices; and an over-the-air update system available in the Settings app.</p>
<p>When asked about LiveG's commitment to protecting its users and their devices against future software vulnerabilities, LiveG's cybersecurity lead, tramcrazy, said that "security has always been at the forefront of all our development here at LiveG, and the new update system reinforces this commitment to keeping users safe and ensuring data integrity.</p>
<p>"The cryptographically signed update packages and innovative update functionality, along with an easy rollback system, ensure that users have a smooth, safe and genuinely pleasant update experience.</p>
<p>"Alongside this, the update system allows for easy delivery of patches as soon as they become available, which means that LiveG OS users are always protected from emerging threats."</p>
<p>Livesey notes that "LiveG OS is far from being usable" as a daily-drivable operating system. "However", he adds, "we've got many plans for our next release of LiveG OS, and even more for future releases. We hope to build a few system apps for our next release, including a file manager app and a few apps with cellular features for mobile devices, which would greatly improve the usability of the operating system".</p>
<p>Livesey even hints about plans to integrate Linux app support into LiveG OS. He says, "LiveG OS is itself a Linux-based operating system, but with a few architectual differences that better suit it for web apps. That being said, we'd like to add the necessary support to allow XWindows-based Linux apps to run in our gShell desktop environment. We might not see this for version 0.3.0, but it's certainly on our radar".</p>
<p>LiveG OS is available for download in English and French for the PinePhone and Raspberry Pi, in addition to x86-64 and ARM64 computers, at <a href="/os">liveg.tech/os</a>.</p>
