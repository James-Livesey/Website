                <h2>Our approach</h2>
                <p>Digital technology has been known to transform not only many aspects of our daily lives, but also the world around us. While many of these transformations have enhanced our world, sadly, some of the impacts of the introduction of various digital technologies have been negative, causing inequality between individuals, drastic changes to our climate, and disruption to our health as a society — just to name a few.</p>
                <p>As a technology organisation, we understand that we have a large responsibility for the products and services we develop, and how they affect our world. We believe that this recognition of responsibility is a key factor that differentiates us from other organisations. As such, our approach is to make our technologies open, user-friendly, secure, accessible, sustainable and engineered to last. To this end, we wish to become a leader in the technology industry for both the projects we create and our ethical approach.</p>
                <p>Being an organisation that is mainly operated by young individuals, we want to apply our fresh, new perspectives to our world through the use of technology, but we understand that we must be careful with our knowledge and learn from the experiences of our older friends so as to not tread down the wrong path.</p>
                <p>When we build our own products from the ground up, some with a more critical view believe that we're reinventing the wheel; but that's not true. We believe that true innovation starts when we invent our own wheels — better wheels. That is how we learn to produce better products.</p>
                <p>LiveG is in a unique position in valuing its users over gaining high profits. Ethically speaking, we simply want to do what's best for the world as a whole, and not just for ourselves. This includes making donations to existing open-source porjects that we rely on to build our own projects — and even charities which we believe we should support — when we have money left over from the revenues we produce.</p>
                <p>We hope that your interest in LiveG helps to provide an investment in what LiveG does, and the world around it. The more people who support us, the better we will be equipped to weaken the monopolies of the big tech companies as a diverse competitor. We want to make products which let or help people advance our world, and we will be immensely proud of anyone who does.</p>
