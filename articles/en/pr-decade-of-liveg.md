**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**NORWICH, ENGLAND:** LiveG Technologies today celebrates a decade of operation with a new pre-release of its multiplatform operating system, LiveG OS.

LiveG OS includes several new features and improvements to bring the operating system to the organisation's mission of building open and inclusive software and hardware that is designed for everyone and built to last.

The most prominent addition to LiveG OS is its new support for command-line and graphical Linux apps. Founder and lead developer of LiveG, James Livesey, said: "the new Linux app integration features open up many possibilities and new use cases for LiveG OS that we hope make the operating system appeal to developers, system administrators and users of legacy software. As a frequent user of Linux applications myself, I know that this feature brings enormous value to LiveG OS."

Other notable features that are new to LiveG OS are productivity apps — a file manager and a calculator app — the latter of which, Livesey reckons is "the most advanced built-in calculator app seen in any operating system yet".

LiveG OS's new release now makes the system available in the Catalan language thanks to translation work completed by international contributors; and the new release also brings improved support for accessibility through its new screen reader — Readout Navigation — which allows users who are blind or visually impaired to use the system through spoken audio cues or refreshable braille displays.

Looking ahead for the next year, LiveG hopes to improve mobile support for LiveG OS by introducing features for phone calling, text messaging and browsing the internet by using cellular data. The organisation also hopes to improve its search engine — LiveG Search — by increasing web crawling efforts, and it plans to develop tools to empower individuals to make impactful contributions to LiveG's projects.

The latest version of LiveG OS is available for download in English, French and Catalan for the PinePhone and Raspberry Pi 4 and 5, in addition to x86-64 and ARM64 computers, at [liveg.tech/os](/os).
