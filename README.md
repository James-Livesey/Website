## Testing locally
To test locally, launch a local web server in the `src` directory. This is where the root of the website is.

A convenient way to start a web server is to run the following command:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

You should then be able to access the website locally by visiting [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.
